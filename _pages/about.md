This is Jiyuan Wang's home on the web

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at University of California, Los Angeles. I am interested in designing novel SE tools for a new heterogenous computing landscape. I have worked on an automated testing technique to expedite differential testing for CPU vs. FPGA. I also have worked an automated fuzz testing technique for big data applications running on Apache Spark.. I am a member of SOLAR group and co-advised by Professor Miryung Kim and Professor Harry Xu.

Before joining UCLA, I earned my B.E. in Physics from Tsinghua University in 2019, and I was a research intern working with Professor Yu Jiang.
